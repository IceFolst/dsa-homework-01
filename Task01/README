works made by Alexandre Bacquet
On my personal computer i have ubuntu 22.04 which use sfml 2.5.1
So i coded in sfml 2.5.1 and sfml 3.0, you will need just to comment a couple of line to change from version
in the Flower.cpp file in the function updateAnimation() anf in the file Source.cpp there are two main,
one commented is the sfml 2.5.1 version.

I have also made a Makefile
with just make it compile the code
and ./main run the code.
And there is also a make clean
